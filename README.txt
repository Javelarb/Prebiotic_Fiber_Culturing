#UCI prebiotic fiber culturing 
This repository is for the ongoing fiber culturing occuring in Katrine Whiteson's lab as part of an effort to understand how dietary fibers are utilized by the gut microbiota.  
* Briefly, 30 fecal samples from US and Moroccan individuals were cultured anaerobically.  
* Conditions: 37C, BHI media, 0 & 24 hour time points, shotgun metagenomic sequencing.
